## Lab 1
Java primitives and control flow

## Feature 1 : Pluralize
A function that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

## Feature 2 : Flipping Coins
A function that accepts an integer and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. 

## Feature 3 : Command Line Clock
A function that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button in their IDE. Each time should only be printed once.
