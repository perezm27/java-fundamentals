Inheritance and Interfaces

## Feature 1 : Create Restaurant class & constructor
Create a class to represent a Restaurant. Each Restaurant should have a name, a number of stars between 0 and 5, and a price category (i.e. number of dollar signs).

## Feature 2 : Create Review class & constructor
Create a class to represent a Review. Each Review should have a body, an author, and a number of stars.

## Feature 3 : Implement Reviews
A Review should be about a single Restaurant. Choose an implementation for this, and implement it.

## Feature 4 : Add Reviews
Add an instance method addReview to your Restaurant class. This method should take in a Review instance, and associate that review with this Restaurant. The specific methodology for this will vary, depending on the implementation you chose above.

## Feature 5 : Update Restaurant Review rating
Ensure that your addReview method updates the Restaurant star rating appropriately, and add tests.
